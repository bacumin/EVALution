# EVALution
Dataset containing Semantic Relations and Metadata, for Training and Evaluating Distributional Semantic Models


Abstract

In this paper, we introduce EVALution 1.0, a dataset designed for the training and the evaluation of Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs). This version consists of almost 7.5K tuples, instantiating several semantic relations between word pairs (including hypernymy, synonymy, antonymy, meronymy). The dataset is enriched with a large amount of additional information (i.e. relation domain, word frequency, word POS, word semantic field, etc.) that can be used for either filtering the pairs or perform an in-depth analysis of the results. The tuples are initially extracted from a combination of ConceptNet 5.0 and WordNet 4.0, and subsequently filtered through automatic methods and crowdsourcing in order to ensure their quality. The dataset is freely downloadable1 . An extension in RDF format, including also scripts for data processing, is under consideration.
